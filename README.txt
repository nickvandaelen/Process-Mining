To Run Markdown file:

Start by running cell at the top that imports all the libraries that will be used. 

Next run the cell under the header Feature Engineering. This step imports the data. 
	If you get an error, make sure the .csv file, BPI_Challenge_2017.csv is saved in your working directory
	
	You can change your working directory with the following line of code, replacing Filepath with the path to where the data is 	saved
	import os 
	os.chdir('Filepath')

Continue running each cell. Some take a while to run, especially the ones that fit the neural networks
All graphics should appear automatically.
